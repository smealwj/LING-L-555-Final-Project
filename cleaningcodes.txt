The following codes were used to "clean" the corpora.
By clean, I mean the removal of Latin characters not intentionally written by the user. 
This includes retweets automatically reiterating another user's username as well as https links included in tweets.

This Linux code was used to remove usernames from the corpora:
sed -e 's/@[^[:space:]]*//g'

This Linux code was used to remove https hyperlinks from the corpora:
sed -e 's!https\{0,1\}://[^[:space:]]*!!g' filename.txt
